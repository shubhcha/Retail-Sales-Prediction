# Retail-Sales-Prediction
Machine Learning : Regression Project

We are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. We have to create a Machine Learning model to predict the sales.

Introduction

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

This project include Exploratory data analysis, Data preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Model building and evaluation. The models we used are Lenear Regressor, Lasso Regressor, Ridge Regressor, DecisionTree Regressor, RandomForest Regressor, XGBoost . For evaluating the model we use MSE, RMSE, RMPSE, R2 score.

DATASET INFORMATION

This dataset consist of two csv files:

    Rossmann.csv - Datat including sales Rossmann.csv file
    Store.csv - Data about the store Store.csv file
#Approach to the Project
1.Data Collection and Cleaning

    Check for duplicate values in the dataset
    Checking null values
    Examining the dataset to get basic informations
    Merging the two dataset.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis

    Using different interactive plots made needed analysis
    Univariate Analysis
    Bivariate Analysis
    Multivariate Analysis
